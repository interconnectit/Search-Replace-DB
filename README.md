# Search Replace DB - v4.1.3

This script was made to aid the process of migrating PHP and MySQL
based websites. Works with most common CMSes.

If you find a problem let us know in the issues area and if you can
improve the code then please fork the repository and send us a pull
request :)

## What's New
 * Support for continuous integration through Travis CI
 * Ability to do multiple search-replaces
 * Ability to exclude tables
 * Remove specific loaders for WP
 * No longer automatically populate DB fields, this was causing security issues for users leaving the script on their site
 * Script now checks whether the correct version of PHP is used
 * Script checks if necessary modules are installed
 * Script checks if the connection is secure and gives a warning otherwise
 * Bug fixes
 * UI Tweaks
 * Password is not mandatory in CLI
 * Ability to connect using SSL, command line only feature

## Warnings & Limitations

We can't test every possible case, though we do our best. Backups and
verifications are important.

You use this script at your own risk and we have no responsibility for
any problems it may cause.

There are many edge cases and WordPress plugins that likes to mess
your database, we don't have a silver bullet.

php srdb.cli.php -h dbhost -n dbname -u root -p "password" -s "search" -r "replace"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing works after the search/replace operation!

It's time to use your backups!

### I get a popup saying there was an AJAX error

This happens occasionally and could be for a couple of reasons:

 * When the script starts, it attempts to start your WordPress or
   Drupal installation to auto-detect your username and password
   settings. If this fails, you will see a message informing you that
   auto-detection failed. You will have to enter your details
   manually.

 * Script was unable to set the timeout so PHP closed the connection
   before the table could be processed, this can happen on some server
   configurations.
